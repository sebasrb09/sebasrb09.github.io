# Set Game

The Set game is a popular card game. It was designed by Marsha Falco in 1974. The game consists of finding a SET of 3 cards in a board of 12 cards. The cards will have four different attributes:

- Shape
- Color
- Number
- Filling

A set is defined when for each of the attributes, all cards have the same or each one is different. A set can be when all three cards have a different feature for each attribute.

In my demo, just go to the Game tab, and click the 'Start Game' button. Find a set and click the cards that form it. If you can't find a set, you can click on the button 'There is no set'. 

This is a very competitive game with friends. It can be really fast, so this tool can be a solo practice or also to enjoy and play by yourself.

You can play my implementation of the game here:
